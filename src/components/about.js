<h1>Hi, I'm Badr</h1>
<p>I am a web developer/designer based in Arizona, USA. I take delight in building websites and web apps. 
I’m good at wireframing, problem solving and converting design into code. 
When I’m not coding, I’d be solving Javascript algorithms. When I’m not solving problems, I’d be singing and playing guitar.  </p>
